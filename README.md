crete a folder for the project name it something and navigate to it and create and activate a virtual environment and activate.
now in that same folder create another folder called flask_app and paste all the downloaded file.
navigate to flask_app and run app.py, make sure to have all the libraries installed first. this should cover everything: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn torch pytorch-lightning scikit-learn imbalanced-learn fastapi flask flask-login flask-wtf flask-sqlalchemy bootstrap gridjs
if i missed something an error will pop react accordingly.

to make virtual env go to desired directory and do this :  python3 -m venv env
then activate it by doing this : On Windows: env\Scripts\activate   On macOS/Linux: source env/bin/activate
